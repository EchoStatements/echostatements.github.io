My thesis explored memory and stability in Echo State Networks. Drawing on tools from control theory, I gave exact expressions for calculating the memory capacity of these networks. I also looked at the "different timescales" phenomenon in recurrent neural networks, characterising the phenomenon both in terms of the memory capacity of deep network layers and in terms of how the sensitivity of different layers to perturbations in input varies over time.
