I am a machine learning postdoc at the University of Manchester in the Department of Computer Science working under [Gavin Brown](https://profgavinbrown.github.io/). My research interests include ensemble methods in machine learning, uncertainty estimation, Bayesian deep learning and recurrent neural networks. I also take an interest in applications of differential geometry to machine learning, particularly through information geometry.

Prior to my current role, I have completed a PhD studying the memory and stability of recurrent neural networks (supervised by [Ke Chen](http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~kechen/) and co-supervised by [Paul Glendinning](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/paul.glendinning/)), interned at IBM working on Bayesian deep learning and completed an MSc looking at the representations learnt by unsupervised models.
I also have an interest in applications of machine learning to healthcare having participated in last year's PhysioNet challenge on a team lead by [Dave Wong](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/david.wong/).
